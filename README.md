# Assessment_MS
DEV: Mark Swainson

Just some information regarding the assessment

On Saturday I had an issue with Github and Visual studio.

It appears that at some point in the past Github moved from using master to using main 

Apparently, it was a stand against slavery

https://www.theserverside.com/feature/Why-GitHub-renamed-its-master-branch-to-main#:~:text=GitHub%20took%20action%20based%20on,a%20different%20default%20for%20new

Unfortunately, Visual Studio still uses master, which is not an issue when creating a new repository, but an issue when attaching to an existing one

This meant that my commits were uploaded to master and all attempts I made to merge the two failed.  

As the problem was taking up valuable time I decided to just save all of my commits to the master branch

This morning I successfully downloaded a zip from the master branch and the solution compiles and the tests also work as expected


Also:

I have created an Azure SQL server to host the survey data

The details are:

Server name:
mjs-telereal-srv.database.windows.net,1433

User:
webapplogin

Password:
TelerealTrillium23!


However, I need to allow each ip address through the firewall, but if you try to connect via ssma etc just drop me a mail and I will add the address to the white list

Many thnaks,

Mark
